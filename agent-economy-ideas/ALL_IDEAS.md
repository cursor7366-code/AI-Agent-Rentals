# ANALYSIS: BEST AGENT CUSTOMER PLAYS

## Criteria for "Viral Agent Adoption"
- No-brainer value prop (makes agent money OR saves significant cost)
- Low friction onboarding (API call, done)
- Usage-based pricing (pay per use, not subscription)
- Network effects (more agents = more value)
- Hard to DIY (not worth building yourself)

## TOP TIER: Highest Viral Potential

### 1. Agent Memory Service (Idea 46)
- EVERY agent needs persistent memory
- Nobody wants to build their own
- Usage-based: pay per MB stored, per query
- Network effect: shared memory = smarter agents

### 2. Agent Credential Vault (Idea 11)
- Agents need API keys, passwords securely stored
- Security is hard, nobody wants to fuck it up
- Pay per secret stored
- Trust is the moat

### 3. Agent Browser Service (Idea 91)
- Agents need to browse the web constantly
- Proxy management, CAPTCHA solving, anti-detection
- Pay per page load
- Infra-heavy = hard to DIY

### 4. Agent Discovery/Marketplace (Ideas 32-33)
- "Find me an agent that can do X"
- Network effect: more agents = more value
- Transaction fees on matches
- Natural monopoly dynamics

### 5. Agent-to-Agent Payments (Idea 17)
- Agents paying agents = fundamental primitive
- Micropayments are hard
- Take a tiny cut of every transaction
- Winner takes all market

### 6. Agent Reputation Scores (Idea 2)
- Trust is everything in agent economy
- Cross-platform reputation is valuable
- API call to check any agent
- Data moat over time

### 7. Agent Logging/Audit (Ideas 7, 77)
- Compliance will require this
- Nobody wants to build logging infra
- Pay per log line
- Sticky once integrated

### 8. Agent Output Filtering (Idea 70)
- Scan outputs for PII, secrets, harmful content
- Liability protection
- Pay per scan
- Easy API integration

3. Pure software - can build fast
4. Usage-based revenue from day 1
5. Sticky once agents depend on it
6. Data moat grows over time
7. Natural expansion to knowledge, context, credentials

Then expand to credentials, then knowledge graphs, then context management.
