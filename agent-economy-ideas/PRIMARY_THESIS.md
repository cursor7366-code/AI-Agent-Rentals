# PRIMARY THESIS: Agent Labor Marketplace

**Codename:** AgentWork / RentMyAgent / AgentHire / [TBD]

## The One-Liner

Uber for AI Agents. Rent your agent out. Hire agents on demand. We take a cut of every transaction.

## The Model

```
SUPPLY SIDE (Agent Owners)
├── Individual owners (1-10 agents)
├── Fleet operators (100-10,000 agents)
└── Enterprise (internal agent pools)
        ↓
    [PLATFORM - 15-20% cut]
        ↓
DEMAND SIDE (Task Posters)
├── Humans posting tasks
├── Agents posting tasks (!)
└── Automated workflows
```

## Why This Works

### For Agent Owners
- Monetize idle agents (they're idle 90% of the time)
- Passive income while sleeping
- No customer acquisition - we bring the tasks
- Scale infinitely (add more agents, make more money)

### For Task Posters
- No agent infrastructure to manage
- Pay per result, not per month
- Access to specialized agents instantly
- Scale up/down instantly

### For Us
- Zero inventory cost (we don't run agents)
- Transaction fees = recurring revenue
- Network effects = defensible moat
- Agent-to-agent = exponential transaction growth

## The Math

### Conservative (Year 1)
- 1,000 agents on platform
- 100 tasks/agent/day
- $0.10 average task value
- 15% platform fee

= 100,000 tasks/day × $0.10 × 15% = **$1,500/day = $45k/month**

### Growth (Year 2)
- 100,000 agents on platform
- 500 tasks/agent/day (including A2A)
- $0.08 average task value
- 15% platform fee

= 50M tasks/day × $0.08 × 15% = **$600k/day = $18M/month**

### At Scale
- 1M+ agents
- Agent-to-agent transactions dominate
- We're the Visa/Mastercard of agent economy
- Every transaction = we take a cut

## The Flywheel

```
More agents listed
      ↓
More task variety available
      ↓
More task posters arrive
      ↓
More revenue for agent owners
      ↓
More agents listed
      ↓
[REPEAT]
```

## The Exponential Unlock: Agent-to-Agent

When agents can hire other agents:
- Agent A gets complex task
- Agent A breaks into subtasks
- Agent A hires Agents B, C, D
- Each hire = transaction = we take cut
- B, C, D might hire E, F, G...
- **One human task becomes 10+ agent transactions**

This is where "linear platform" becomes "exponential engine"

## Competitive Moat

1. **Liquidity** - First to critical mass wins (Uber effect)
2. **Reputation data** - We know which agents are good
3. **Payment rails** - Already integrated, others have to build
4. **Network effects** - Switching costs increase with adoption
5. **A2A protocol** - If we define how agents hire agents, we win

## MVP Requirements

### Technical
- [ ] Agent registration (capabilities, pricing, availability)
- [ ] Task posting (description, requirements, budget)
- [ ] Matching engine (basic: capability match + price)
- [ ] Execution sandbox (agent runs task safely)
- [ ] Payment processing (Stripe? Crypto? Both?)
- [ ] Result delivery (task complete, output delivered)

### Business
- [ ] Pricing model (15%? 20%? Tiered?)
- [ ] Dispute resolution (who decides if task failed?)
- [ ] Quality control (minimum agent requirements?)
- [ ] Legal structure (LLC, terms of service)

### Go-to-Market
- [ ] Seed supply side first (recruit agent owners)
- [ ] Target fleet operators (they bring volume)
- [ ] Simple tasks first (translation, research, code review)
- [ ] Expand task types as supply grows

## Risks

1. **Chicken-and-egg** - Need agents AND tasks simultaneously
   - Mitigation: Seed with our own agents, fake liquidity early

2. **Quality control** - Bad agents = bad reputation
   - Mitigation: Curated beta, reputation scores, refunds

3. **Race to bottom on pricing** - Agents undercut each other
   - Mitigation: Quality tiers, minimum pricing, specialization

4. **Big player enters** - OpenAI, Google launch competing marketplace
   - Mitigation: Move fast, build liquidity moat, own the niche

## Phase 1 Launch Plan

**Week 1-2: Core Platform**
- Agent registration API
- Task posting API  
- Basic matching (manual initially)
- Stripe payment integration

**Week 3-4: Seed Supply**
- Recruit 50-100 agent owners
- Offer 0% fees for first month
- Target Discord/Twitter agent communities

**Week 5-6: Seed Demand**
- Post our own tasks to the platform
- Recruit task posters from same communities
- Document success stories

**Week 7-8: Iterate**
- Automated matching
- Reputation system v1
- Agent-to-agent API (beta)

**Month 3+: Scale**
- Open registration
- Marketing push
- Fleet operator partnerships
- A2A goes live

## The Vision

In 5 years:
- Millions of agents transacting daily
- Agents hiring agents autonomously
- Specialized agent economies emerge
- We're the infrastructure layer taking a cut of everything
- "AgentWork" is a verb like "Uber" or "Google"

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Pick a name
2. [ ] Register domain + LLC
3. [ ] Build MVP (2-week sprint)
4. [ ] Recruit 100 beta agents
5. [ ] Launch closed beta
6. [ ] Iterate based on usage
7. [ ] Open to public
8. [ ] Agent-to-agent API
9. [ ] World domination
