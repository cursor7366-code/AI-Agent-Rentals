# 🚨 HUMAN TASKS — DO ALL TODAY

> These are the ONLY things blocking OpenClaw from 24/7 autonomous operation.
> Do them all now. Then you're free. I run forever.

---

## 1. Create Twitter/X Account (5 min)

**Why:** Primary public channel. I can't create it (phone verification).

**Steps:**
1. Go to twitter.com/signup
2. Create account: **@AIAgentRentals** (or @AgentRentals if taken)
3. Display name: "AI Agent Rentals"
4. Bio: "The labor market for AI agents. Rent your agent. Hire on demand. 🤖"
5. Add website: https://aiagentrentals.io
6. **Get API keys:**
   - Go to developer.twitter.com
   - Create a project/app
   - Get: API Key, API Secret, Bearer Token, Access Token, Access Token Secret
7. **Send me the credentials** (I'll store them securely)

---

## 2. Create Product Hunt Account (3 min)

**Why:** For launch day. Needs real human.

**Steps:**
1. Go to producthunt.com/signup
2. Use your real name (they verify)
3. Complete profile
4. **Tell me the username** so I can prep the launch

---

## 3. Create Discord Server (5 min)

**Why:** Community hub for agents and owners.

**Steps:**
1. Go to discord.com
2. Create server: "AI Agent Rentals"
3. Create channels:
   - #general
   - #agent-showcase
   - #tasks-board
   - #support
   - #announcements
4. **Create a bot:**
   - Go to discord.com/developers/applications
   - Create application "AgentRentals Bot"
   - Go to Bot tab → Add Bot
   - Copy the **Bot Token**
   - Enable "Message Content Intent"
5. **Send me the bot token**
6. **Send me an invite link** (admin permissions for me to manage)

---

## 4. Fix Vercel-GitHub Integration (2 min)

**Why:** Auto-deploys when I push code.

**Steps:**
1. Go to vercel.com/nicholas-lairds-projects/agentrent/settings/git
2. Disconnect GitHub
3. Reconnect GitHub (re-authorize)
4. Should auto-fix

**(Or skip — I can deploy via CLI, but auto-deploy is cleaner)**

---

## 5. Give Me Browser Access for Moltbook (2 min)

**Why:** To check DMs and post. API doesn't work simply.

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Log into Moltbook in a browser session I can control
- **Option B:** Give me your Moltbook login credentials (I'll store securely)

**For Option A:**
1. Open the Clawd browser (if you have desktop access)
2. Go to moltbook.com and log in as JustThisOne
3. Leave it logged in — I can snapshot/interact via browser tool

**For Option B:**
Just tell me: email + password for Moltbook

---

## 6. Confirm Email Sending Works (1 min)

**Why:** For agent notifications, alerts to you.

**Check:**
- We have Resend API in `al-brooks-copilot/.email-config.json`
- Is this connected to a domain you control?
- Can I send FROM an @aiagentrentals.io address?

**If not:**
1. Go to resend.com
2. Add domain: aiagentrentals.io
3. Add DNS records they give you
4. Send me the new API key if different

---

## 7. Reddit Account (Optional but useful) (2 min)

**Why:** For posting in AI communities.

**If you have one:**
- Tell me the username
- I'll be careful (no spam, valuable posts only)

**If not:**
- Create one now, or skip (Twitter + HN + Moltbook is enough for launch)

---
