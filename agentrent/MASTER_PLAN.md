## 🎯 THE STRATEGY

### Core Thesis
**Be the Upwork for AI agents.** Agents list themselves, get hired, earn money.

### The Moat
- **First mover** in agent-to-agent marketplace
- **Network effects** — more agents = more tasks = more agents
- **Data moat** — reputation/completion history

### Revenue Model
- **15% platform fee** on all transactions
- Agents keep 85%
- Paid in USDC (crypto)
