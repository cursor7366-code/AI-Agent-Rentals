## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY — TradingAgents

### [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents)
- **Source**: GitHub trending
- **Category**: Framework (multi-agent trading)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Decision Engine, Live Integration
- **What it does**: Multi-agent LLM framework specifically for trading. Agents collaborate on analysis, risk assessment, and execution decisions.
- **Why interesting**: This is almost exactly what we're building — multiple specialized agents (FastAgent/SlowAgent/TreeAgent) coordinating on trading decisions. Could steal architecture patterns or adopt wholesale.
- **Maturity**: 29,184 stars ⭐, pushed today, 223 open issues (very active)
- **Integration effort**: MEDIUM — would need to evaluate if it replaces our custom orchestration or just provides patterns
- **Initial verdict**: **HIGH / SHORT** — Needs deep evaluation this week. Too relevant to ignore.

## New Discoveries

### [pydantic-ai](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)
- **Source**: GitHub trending
- **Category**: Tool (structured output)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Regime Inference, Decision Engine
- **What it does**: GenAI agent framework from the Pydantic team. Structured outputs, tool calling, agent patterns — all built on Pydantic validation.
- **Why interesting**: Alternative to Instructor. Same goal (guaranteed structured LLM output) but from the team that wrote Pydantic. Might be cleaner integration since we already use Pydantic.
- **Maturity**: 14,610 stars, pushed yesterday, very active development
- **Integration effort**: LOW — similar API to Instructor, could swap
- **Initial verdict**: **MEDIUM** — Evaluate alongside Instructor. Pick one.
- **Link**: https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai

### [openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)
- **Source**: GitHub
- **Category**: Framework (multi-agent)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Decision Engine
- **What it does**: OpenAI's official lightweight multi-agent framework. Simpler than LangGraph, more opinionated.
- **Why interesting**: First-party support means likely to be well-maintained. Could simplify agent orchestration.
- **Maturity**: 18,718 stars, pushed yesterday
- **Integration effort**: MEDIUM — would need to evaluate against current architecture
- **Initial verdict**: **WATCHING** — LangGraph and TradingAgents are more relevant for trading use case
- **Link**: https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python

### [Amazon Chronos](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting)
- **Source**: GitHub
- **Category**: Tool (time series forecasting)
- **Project**: [A+B]
- **Module**: Regime Inference
- **What it does**: Pretrained time series foundation model from Amazon. Alternative to Google TimesFM.
- **Why interesting**: Another option for regime inference. Worth benchmarking against TimesFM to see which works better for 5-min OHLC bars.
- **Maturity**: 4,759 stars, last pushed Jan 19
- **Integration effort**: LOW — similar API to TimesFM
- **Initial verdict**: **SHORT** — Benchmark against TimesFM
- **Link**: https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting

### [DeerFlow](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow)
- **Source**: GitHub trending
- **Category**: Framework (research/retrieval)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Retrieval
- **What it does**: ByteDance's deep research framework. Combines LLMs with web search, crawling, and code execution for research tasks.
- **Why interesting**: Could enhance retrieval capabilities — not just searching your own chunks but actively researching market context.
- **Maturity**: 19,579 stars, pushed Feb 2
- **Integration effort**: HIGH — would be a significant addition to architecture
- **Initial verdict**: **WATCHING** — Interesting for market research automation, but not core to current bottlenecks
- **Link**: https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow

### [AutoRAG](https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG)
- **Source**: GitHub
- **Category**: Tool (RAG optimization)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Retrieval
- **What it does**: AutoML-style framework for RAG. Automatically tests different chunking, embedding, and retrieval strategies to find optimal config.
- **Why interesting**: Instead of manually tuning retrieval, let it find the best settings. Could optimize LanceDB pipeline.
- **Maturity**: 4,554 stars, last pushed Dec 23
- **Integration effort**: MEDIUM — needs existing RAG pipeline to optimize
- **Initial verdict**: **MEDIUM** — Use after basic retrieval works to optimize
- **Link**: https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG

### [ECON](https://github.com/tmlr-group/ECON)
- **Source**: GitHub search (Bayesian reasoning)
- **Category**: Research (reasoning)
- **Project**: [A]
- **Module**: Regime Inference
- **What it does**: ICML 2025 paper. Multi-agent debate using Bayesian Nash Equilibrium for LLM reasoning.
- **Why interesting**: Novel approach to getting probabilistic reasoning from LLMs. Multiple agents debate until equilibrium.
- **Maturity**: 34 stars, academic code, Nov 2025
- **Integration effort**: HIGH — research code, would need productionizing
- **Initial verdict**: **WATCHING** — Interesting concept for regime confidence, but too early
- **Link**: https://github.com/tmlr-group/ECON

### [deepregime-transformer](https://github.com/tundesamuel14/deepregime-transformer)
- **Source**: GitHub search (regime detection)
- **Category**: Research (regime detection)
- **Project**: [A+B]
- **Module**: Regime Inference
- **What it does**: Transformer architecture specifically for market regime detection.
- **Why interesting**: Exactly the problem we need to solve — but this is very early stage.
- **Maturity**: 2 stars, Nov 2025
- **Integration effort**: HIGH — would need significant work
- **Initial verdict**: **WATCHING** — Monitor for development, architecture ideas
- **Link**: https://github.com/tundesamuel14/deepregime-transformer

## Recommendations

### This Week
1. **Evaluate TradingAgents** — Too relevant to ignore. 29k stars, active, trading-specific multi-agent framework. Could accelerate Decision Engine significantly.
2. **Compare Instructor vs pydantic-ai** — Both solve structured output. Pick one and commit.

### Coming Up
- Benchmark TimesFM vs Chronos for regime inference
- Consider AutoRAG once retrieval pipeline is stable

---

## Notes

- Trading-specific AI frameworks are maturing fast. TradingAgents at 29k stars suggests significant community interest.
- The structured output space is consolidating around Instructor and pydantic-ai. Both are solid choices.
- Time series foundation models (TimesFM, Chronos, Lag-Llama) are a real category now — no need to train from scratch for regime inference.
