## New Discoveries

### 🔥 Aurora — Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model
- **Source**: GitHub / HuggingFace
- **Category**: Regime Inference, Signal Extraction
- **Project**: [A]
- **What it does**: First pretrained *multimodal* time series foundation model. Combines text context (news, events, domain knowledge) with time series data for probabilistic forecasting via flow matching.
- **Why interesting**: This is a paradigm shift. Instead of just feeding OHLC bars, you can inject context like "Fed announcement today, market likely news-driven" and the model uses that to inform predictions. Perfect for regime inference where context matters.
- **How you'd use it**: Feed OHLC bars + text context describing market conditions → get regime probabilities with domain knowledge baked in. Could replace regime_inference.py entirely or augment TimesFM.
- **Maturity check**: ICLR 2026 paper (peer-reviewed), `pip install aurora-model`, active development
- **Initial verdict**: **HIGH** — Solves the "how do I inject domain knowledge into regime inference" problem
- **Link**: https://github.com/DecisionIntelligence/Aurora

### Salesforce MoiraiAgent — Expert Selection Tool
- **Source**: HuggingFace
- **Category**: Regime Inference, Ensemble
- **Project**: [A]
- **What it does**: Meta-model that selects the best prediction from multiple forecasting models. "Top-performing forecasters exhibit unique advantages when applied to time series from specific domains or with particular patterns."
- **Why interesting**: Instead of betting on ONE time series model, run several (TimesFM, Chronos, Aurora) and let MoiraiAgent pick the best prediction for each situation. Automatic ensemble without manual rules.
- **How you'd use it**: Run TimesFM + Chronos + Aurora in parallel → MoiraiAgent picks the winner. Covers edge cases where one model excels.
- **Maturity check**: 3B params, Salesforce research, new (8 days ago)
- **Initial verdict**: **MEDIUM** — Interesting meta-approach, but need core models working first
- **Link**: https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/moirai-agent

### LangChain 1.2.x — Dynamic Tool Registration
- **Source**: GitHub Releases
- **Category**: Agent Architecture
- **Project**: [A]
- **What it does**: New middleware system allows dynamic tool registration during agent runs. Tools can be added/modified based on context.
- **Why interesting**: For the decision engine, this means tools available to the agent can change based on market regime. In ranging mode → different tools than trending mode.
- **Maturity check**: langchain-core 1.2.9, very active development
- **Initial verdict**: **LOW** — Nice-to-have, not blocking anything
- **Link**: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/releases

### IBM Granite TTM r2 — Time Series Foundation Model
- **Source**: HuggingFace
- **Category**: Regime Inference
- **Project**: [A+B]
- **What it does**: IBM's second iteration of Tiny Time Mixer (TTM). 805k params, very efficient.
- **Why interesting**: Extremely lightweight alternative to TimesFM. Could run on CPU for backtesting.
- **Maturity check**: 151 likes on HF, IBM backing
- **Initial verdict**: **WATCHING** — Good for resource-constrained scenarios
- **Link**: https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2

## Radar Updates (Existing Tools Checked)

### ⬆️ TimesFM → Updated to 2.5 (CRITICAL UPDATE)
- **Previous**: 7.7k stars, 500M params, 2048 context
- **Now**: 200M params (60% smaller!), 16k context (8x longer!), continuous quantile forecasts
- **What changed**:
  - Down to 200M params from 500M — faster inference
  - Supports 16k context length (up from 2048) — can see more history
  - Continuous quantile forecast up to 1k horizon via optional 30M quantile head
  - Removed frequency indicator requirement — simpler API
- **Impact**: **MAJOR** — This addresses the "need longer context for market structure" issue
- **Action**: Stay at NOW, update docs to use 2.5

### ⬆️ TradingAgents v0.2.0 Released (BUMP UP)
- **Previous**: 29.2k stars, needed evaluation
- **Now**: 29.2k stars, v0.2.0 with multi-provider LLM support
- **What changed**:
  - Multi-provider support: GPT-5.x, Gemini 3.x, Claude 4.x, Grok 4.x
  - Ollama support for local models
  - Improved system architecture
  - Trading-R1 technical report released
- **Impact**: **SIGNIFICANT** — Now production-ready, patterns directly applicable
- **Action**: Bump from SHORT → NOW (steal patterns this week)

### → Instructor — Stable (No Change)
- **Previous**: 12.3k stars, NOW priority
- **Now**: 3M+ monthly downloads, stable
- **What changed**: Now explicitly recommends PydanticAI for agent workflows. Instructor = extraction, PydanticAI = agents.
- **Impact**: Confirms the Instructor → pydantic-ai graduation path
- **Action**: Keep at NOW for extraction, add note about PydanticAI for agents

## Synthesis & Analysis

### 🧠 The Multimodal Insight
Aurora represents a paradigm shift: **time series + context**. Previously, regime inference meant feeding bars and hoping the model figured out the context. Now you can explicitly tell the model "this is a Fed day, expect news-driven behavior."

**Combination to try**: Aurora (with text context) + TimesFM 2.5 (pure time series) + MoiraiAgent (pick the best). This creates a robust ensemble where:
- TimesFM handles pure pattern recognition
- Aurora handles context-aware predictions
- MoiraiAgent arbitrates when they disagree

### 🔄 The Tool → Agent Transition
Instructor's README now says "Use Instructor for fast extraction, reach for PydanticAI when you need agents." This confirms the architecture: Instructor for the structured outputs in FastAgent, PydanticAI for the more complex SlowAgent/TreeAgent orchestration.

### 📈 TradingAgents is Production-Ready
With v0.2.0 supporting multiple providers and local models, TradingAgents becomes a serious reference implementation. Key patterns to steal:
- Analyst team structure (fundamentals, sentiment, news, technical)
- Researcher debate pattern (bullish vs bearish)
- Risk management as approval gate
This maps directly to the FastAgent/SlowAgent/TreeAgent architecture.

### ⚡ TimesFM 2.5 Changes Everything
The 16k context is huge. At 5-min bars, that's ~55 trading days of history — enough to see weekly/monthly patterns. Combined with the smaller 200M model, this is now fast enough for live inference.

### 🎯 Recommended Priority This Week
1. **TimesFM 2.5** — Update to new version, test with longer context
2. **TradingAgents** — Deep dive on architecture patterns
3. **Aurora** — POC with text context injection
