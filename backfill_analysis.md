---

- **2/12/2025**: 10 listings (4 with address, 40%)
- **2/19/2025**: 10 listings (5 with address, 50%)
- **2/26/2025**: 14 listings (4 with address, 29%)
- **3/5/2025**: 0 listings (no data available)

- **3/19/2025**: 21 listings (12 with address, 57%)

**Overall address availability:** 39/86 (45%)

### 2) Repeat Appearances by Case ID

- Cases appearing in multiple weeks: **2**
- Cases appearing in only one week: **82**

**Repeating cases observed:**
- `859-189`: 2/12/2025, 3/19/2025
- `850-851`: 2/19/2025, 3/19/2025

**Interpretation:** Low repeat rate suggests most sales proceed as scheduled or are removed (redeemed/settled). Postponements are infrequent in this window.

### 3) Writ Amount Distribution

| Bucket | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| <$100K | 23 | 27% |
| $100-200K | 40 | 47% |
| $200-500K | 22 | 26% |
| >$500K | 0 | 0% |

**Interpretation:** Nearly 75% of deals are under $200K — accessible to individual investors without institutional capital.

---

### 4) Week 1 Listings — Persistence Check

- Cases listed in Week 1 (2/5/2025): **10**
- Of those, reappearing in later weeks: **0**
- Postponement/persistence rate: **0%**

**Interpretation:** Week 1 listings did not resurface in the 8-week window. Either sales completed, properties were redeemed, or cases were dismissed.

---

### 5) Address Availability by Writ Amount

| Segment | With Address | Percentage |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| High value (≥$200K) | 13/22 | 59% |
| Low value (<$200K) | 25/63 | 40% |

**Interpretation:** Higher-value properties are *more* likely to have addresses available — contradicting the hypothesis that big deals are harder to act on. Address availability may correlate with case maturity or plaintiff diligence.

---

## Key Findings

1. **ACT NOW volume is constrained:** Only 45% of listings have addresses — roughly 6-7 actionable properties per week
2. **Deal size is investor-friendly:** 74% of writ amounts are <$200K
3. **Repeat rate is low:** Properties rarely appear across multiple weeks — sales move forward or resolve
4. **High-value deals are more actionable:** Address availability is better for ≥$200K properties
5. **Weekly cadence is sufficient:** ~14 listings per sale date; weekly review captures the full funnel

---

## Limitations

- 3/5/2025 and 3/12/2025 returned no data (possible site issue or no scheduled sales)
- Plaintiff name extraction was inconsistent (marked UNKNOWN in many cases)
- No linkage to court calendar data (v3) in this analysis
- This is a snapshot, not a longitudinal study
