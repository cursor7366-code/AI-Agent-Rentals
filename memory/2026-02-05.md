## CVAT Labeling Project Setup

### Project Created
- **CVAT Project:** #365228 "Al Brooks Slides Labeling"
- **URL:** https://app.cvat.ai/projects/365228
- **Credentials:** nicholas02 / Allen04348
- **Slides:** 17 images in `/home/clawdbot/clawd/cvat-slides/Slides/`

### Labels Configured
- candle_box (rectangle) - with polarity + occluded attributes
- zone (rectangle)
- trendline (polyline)
- arrow (polyline)
- text_callout (rectangle)

### Still Needed
- candle_kp skeleton (4 keypoints) - requires manual visual editor setup
- Task creation + slide upload

---

## Two-Layer Labeling Spec (from user)

### Layer 1: Candles (the numeric price world)
For every candle (81-85 per slide):
- 1 rectangle box (`candle_box`) = grouping + ordering
- 4 keypoints (`candle_kp` skeleton):
  - `wick_top` → High
  - `wick_bottom` → Low
  - `body_top` → Close (bull) or Open (bear)
  - `body_bottom` → Open (bull) or Close (bear)

**Polarity determines OHLC mapping:**
- Bull candle: Open = body_bottom, Close = body_top
- Bear candle: Open = body_top, Close = body_bottom
- Doji: open ≈ close (still keep body_top/body_bottom)

**Why rectangle matters:** Not for accuracy. For:
- Grouping (keypoints belong to this candle)
- Ordering candles left→right
- Merge step overlap tests

**Layer 1 output:** Sort candle boxes by x-center → bars 0..N-1
Each bar has numbered index + precise OHLC geometry.

### Layer 2: Overlays (the human "meaning" layer)
Everything instructor drew on top:
- `zone` = rectangles/polygons (entry/exit zones, highlights)
- `trendline` = 2-point polylines (wedge boundaries, channels)
- `arrow` = 2-point polyline (tail→head)
- `text_callout` = tight rectangle around text

**Overlays define:** which region matters, which bars referenced, pattern boundaries, attention points, pattern names

### Why Separate Passes
Overlays cover candles. Labeling both at once:
- Overlay colors distract
- Drift on wick-tip precision
- Miss candles or misplace keypoints
- Candle data becomes noisy → pattern logic breaks

**Rule:**
- Pass A = candles only, ignore overlays
- Pass B = overlays only, ignore candles

### The Merge Process
After labeling, merge by turning overlays into bar index references:
- Candles = numbered ruler (bars 0..84)
- Overlays = shapes that snap onto that ruler

**How each overlay links:**
1. **Zone boxes** → find candle boxes whose center x falls inside → "zone applies to bars [12..18]"
2. **Arrow head** → find nearest candle by x (then y) → "arrow points to bar 27"
3. **Trendline endpoints** → snap to nearest bar, decide high/low by proximity → "trend_line uses (bar 5 high) → (bar 21 high)"
4. **Text callouts** → find nearest arrow/zone → "Wedge Bottom attached to zone z3 / bars 30-44"

### Final Output Structure
```
Bars: indexed 0..84, each with OHLC keypoints
Overlays: shapes and text
Associations: overlays → "refers to bars X-Y" or "points to bar Z"
```

Pattern detection uses true OHLC geometry.
Training labels/supervision come from human overlays.
Overlays become machine-readable via bar index mapping.

### One-Sentence Summary
> Candles are the raw price geometry. Overlays are the human interpretation. Label them separately for accuracy, then merge by snapping overlay geometry onto candle bar indices.
