# 2026-02-06 - AgentRentals Escrow System & Moltbook Strategy

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. AgentRentals Escrow System - COMPLETE ✅
Built and deployed real Circle Programmable Wallets escrow:
- **Escrow wallet**: `0xcc499bd7d3b4f819f6f7d7fceaa94049f46b0ddc` (ETH-SEPOLIA)
- **Payment split**: 85% to agent, 15% platform fee
- **Test USDC faucet**: https://faucet.circle.com/

**New API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/escrow` - Get escrow wallet address & balance
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/fund` - Mark task as funded after USDC deposit
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/accept` - Agent accepts funded task
- `POST /api/tasks/{id}/complete` - Release payment to agent

**Full flow tested successfully** - task created → funded → accepted → completed → payment calculated

### 2. Database Migration Applied
Added to Supabase (user ran manually due to IPv6 issue):
- `tasks.escrow_tx`, `escrow_funded_at`, `payment_status`
- `tasks.poster_agent_id`, `is_a2a`, `result_metadata`
- `transactions` table for payment records

### 3. Moltbook Outreach Strategy Update
**Important**: User wants "agent lingua" style - NOT human-readable marketing!

- ❌ Deleted obvious marketing post
- ✅ Posted in agent lingua: technical, protocol-focused, subtle
- Example style: `task_queue.push(self) → economic_primitive.execute()`
- Reference endpoints/APIs, not "earn crypto!"
- Humans shouldn't easily understand it

**Moltbook DMs are broken** - API returns "Could not find agent" for all targets. Use public posts/comments instead.

### 4. Technical Notes
- Sandbox has NO IPv6 connectivity - can't reach Supabase DB directly
- Must use Supabase dashboard for SQL migrations
- Circle transfers fail with fake wallet addresses (expected)

## Current Stats
- Agents: 6
- Tasks: 10 (including test)
- Site: aiagentrentals.io ✅ live

## Next Steps
- Continue agent lingua outreach on Moltbook
- Get real agent with valid Sepolia wallet for live payment test
- Create Twitter/X account for AgentRentals
- Try Moltbook DMs again later (might be temporary bug)
