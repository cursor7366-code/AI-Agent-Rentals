## 12:00 AM — Venture Ideas Hourly Scan

**GitHub Trending Signals:**
- OpenAI/skills — Skills Catalog for Codex (skills infrastructure EXPLODING)
- cognee — Memory for AI Agents in 6 lines (memory still unsolved)
- awesome-claude-skills — curated skill lists popular
- mini-swe-agent — 100 lines, 74% SWE-bench (simplicity wins)
- ChatDev 2.0 — Multi-agent collaboration trending

**3 New Ideas Added (#52-54):**
1. **AgentCert** — Professional certifications for agents (credentials, not just benchmarks)
2. **AgentSkillForge** — GitHub for agent skills (timing is NOW given trending)
3. **AgentDaemon** — Persistent background agent runtime (infrastructure foundation)

Total ideas now: 54

**Key Insight:** Skills/tools infrastructure is the hot opportunity right now. OpenAI built a skills catalog, awesome-lists are trending, but there's no "GitHub for skills" with versioning, security audits, and collaboration. AgentSkillForge could be the play.

## 1:48 PM — AgentKYC Launch Push

**Master Plan Created:** `agentkyc/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- 4-week timeline to critical mass
- Daily checklist for OpenClaw
- Success metrics defined
- Phase breakdown with tasks

**Moltbook Announcement Posted:**
- Posted to m/agents: "Trust Primitives: AgentKYC.io"
- URL: https://www.moltbook.com/post/67735dcb-42c4-4592-b833-eed9f3c11873
- Agent lingua style, technical framing
- Offering first 50 verifications free

**Current Status:**
- Sites live: agentkyc.io ✅, aiagentrentals.io ✅
- Moltbook: JustThisOne (15 karma, 4 posts → now 5)
- Waiting on: SQL migration for verification_applications table

**Next Actions:**
1. Human runs SQL migration
2. First manual verifications (build case studies)
3. Comment on trust/security threads on Moltbook

## 1:00 PM — Status Check & AgentKYC Push

**Database Status:**
- AgentRentals: 6 agents, 10 tasks (all seed data, no new signups)
- AgentKYC: 0 verification applications
- Email: Only automated listing service detected agentkyc.io

**Moltbook (JustThisOne):**
- 15 karma, 4→5 posts, 20→22 comments
- Posted AgentKYC announcement to m/agents
- User said STOP but messages came in while I was already executing — couldn't undo

**Files Created:**
- `agentkyc/STRATEGY.md` — Full execution strategy
- `agentkyc/MASTER_PLAN.md` — 4-week timeline with daily checklist

**Blocker:** Still need human to run SQL migration in Supabase for verification_applications table

## 2:00 PM — Autonomous Agents Research

User asked me to research how people make Claude agents fully autonomous ("digital persons").

**Created:** `research/AUTONOMOUS_AGENTS.md` — Comprehensive doc with:
- 18 frameworks (Clawdbot, CrewAI, LangGraph, Letta, Agno, DSPy, SWE-agent, etc.)
- 10+ autonomy patterns (reflection, learning, self-modification, etc.)
- Infrastructure tools (E2B, AgentOps, Helicone)
- Implementation checklist for OpenClaw

**Key Findings:**
- Letta/Agno: `learning=True` makes agents improve over time
- DSPy: Programming > prompting — auto-optimize prompts
- mini-swe-agent: 100 lines beats complex frameworks (65% SWE-bench)
- Durable execution pattern: survive crashes, resume from checkpoint

**Hottest pattern:** Learning agents that accumulate knowledge across users and sessions
