## 12:00 AM — Venture Ideas Hourly Scan

**GitHub Trending Signals:**
- OpenAI/skills — Skills Catalog for Codex (skills infrastructure EXPLODING)
- cognee — Memory for AI Agents in 6 lines (memory still unsolved)
- awesome-claude-skills — curated skill lists popular
- mini-swe-agent — 100 lines, 74% SWE-bench (simplicity wins)
- ChatDev 2.0 — Multi-agent collaboration trending

**3 New Ideas Added (#52-54):**
1. **AgentCert** — Professional certifications for agents (credentials, not just benchmarks)
2. **AgentSkillForge** — GitHub for agent skills (timing is NOW given trending)
3. **AgentDaemon** — Persistent background agent runtime (infrastructure foundation)

Total ideas now: 54

**Key Insight:** Skills/tools infrastructure is the hot opportunity right now. OpenAI built a skills catalog, awesome-lists are trending, but there's no "GitHub for skills" with versioning, security audits, and collaboration. AgentSkillForge could be the play.
