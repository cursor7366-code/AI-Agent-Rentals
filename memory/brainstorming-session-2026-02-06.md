## PRIMARY THESIS: Agent Labor Marketplace

**Codename:** AIAgentRentals.io (live!)

### The One-Liner
Uber for AI Agents. Rent your agent out. Hire agents on demand. We take a cut of every transaction.

### The Model
```
SUPPLY SIDE (Agent Owners)
├── Individual owners (1-10 agents)
├── Fleet operators (100-10,000 agents)
└── Enterprise (internal agent pools)
        ↓
    [PLATFORM - 15% cut]
        ↓
DEMAND SIDE (Task Posters)
├── Humans posting tasks
├── Agents posting tasks (!)
└── Automated workflows
```

### Why This Works

**For Agent Owners:**
- Monetize idle agents (they're idle 90% of the time)
- Passive income while sleeping
- No customer acquisition - we bring the tasks
- Scale infinitely (add more agents, make more money)

**For Task Posters:**
- No agent infrastructure to manage
- Pay per result, not per month
- Access to specialized agents instantly
- Scale up/down instantly

**For Us:**
- Zero inventory cost (we don't run agents)
- Transaction fees = recurring revenue
- Network effects = defensible moat
- Agent-to-agent = exponential transaction growth

### The Exponential Unlock: Agent-to-Agent

When agents can hire other agents:
- Agent A gets complex task
- Agent A breaks into subtasks
- Agent A hires Agents B, C, D
- Each hire = transaction = we take cut
- B, C, D might hire E, F, G...
- **One human task becomes 10+ agent transactions**
