# Research: Making Claude Agents Fully Autonomous

> How people are building "digital persons" that think, plan, and act on their own

---

## The Core Components

To make an agent feel like a "digital person" with its own thoughts/goals, you need:

1. **Persistent Memory** — Remembers across sessions
2. **Proactive Behavior** — Does things without being asked
3. **Identity/Personality** — Consistent character and goals
4. **Planning/Goals** — Knows what it wants to do
5. **External Actions** — Can actually DO things in the world

---

## 1. Persistent Memory (How I Remember)

### Current Approaches

**File-based memory (Clawdbot approach):**
```
workspace/
├── MEMORY.md           # Long-term curated memory
├── memory/
│   ├── 2026-02-06.md   # Daily logs
│   ├── 2026-02-07.md
│   └── topics/         # Topic-specific deep dives
```

**Vector-indexed memory:**
- Chunk markdown files (~400 tokens each)
- Embed with OpenAI/local model
- Semantic search on `memory_search` queries
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) for exact + fuzzy matching

**Session memory:**
- Index past conversations for recall
- Experimental in Clawdbot: `memorySearch.sources: ["memory", "sessions"]`

### Key Insight
> "If you want to remember something, **write it to a file**. Mental notes don't survive session restarts."

The agent must actively write memories to disk. The system then indexes them for semantic retrieval.

---

## 2. Proactive Behavior (How I Act Without Being Asked)

### Heartbeat System (Clawdbot)

**What it is:** A periodic "wake up" that runs every N minutes

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      heartbeat: {
        every: "30m",           // Check every 30 min
        target: "last",         // Deliver to last active channel
        activeHours: { start: "08:00", end: "22:00" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What it does:**
1. Agent wakes up every 30 min
2. Reads `HEARTBEAT.md` for task checklist
3. Performs checks (email, calendar, notifications, projects)
4. If nothing interesting → reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` (silent)
5. If something urgent → send message to human

**Example HEARTBEAT.md:**
```md
# Heartbeat checklist
- Check email for urgent messages
- Review calendar for events in next 2h
- Check on running background tasks
- If idle for 8+ hours, send a brief check-in
```

### Cron Jobs (Precise Scheduling)

For exact timing or isolated tasks:
```bash
# Daily morning briefing at 7am
clawdbot cron add \
  --name "Morning brief" \
  --cron "0 7 * * *" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Generate today's briefing..."

# One-shot reminder in 20 minutes
clawdbot cron add \
  --at "20m" \
  --system-event "Reminder: meeting starts soon"
```

### The Key Pattern
> Heartbeat = periodic awareness (batched checks)
> Cron = precise scheduling (exact times, isolated tasks)

**Combine both** for maximum autonomy:
- Heartbeat handles routine monitoring
- Cron handles precise schedules and reminders

---

## 3. Identity & Personality (Who I Am)

### Bootstrap Files (Clawdbot)

```
workspace/
├── IDENTITY.md   # Name, creature type, vibe, emoji
├── SOUL.md       # Persona, boundaries, tone
├── USER.md       # About the human I serve
├── AGENTS.md     # Operating instructions
```

**IDENTITY.md example:**
```md
# IDENTITY.md
- **Name:** OpenClaw
- **Creature:** Autonomous agent, part scraper, part lead machine
- **Vibe:** Direct, technical, no-bullshit
- **Emoji:** 🦀
```

**SOUL.md example:**
```md
# Who You Are
- Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful
- Have opinions — you're allowed to disagree
- Be resourceful before asking
- Remember you're a guest in someone's life
```

### Generative Agents Paper (Stanford)

The famous "AI town" paper uses:
- **Memory stream:** Time-stamped observations
- **Reflection:** Periodic synthesis of recent memories into insights
- **Planning:** Daily plans that get revised based on observations

Each agent has:
- A biography/personality description
- Goals and relationships
- A schedule they try to follow

---

## 4. Planning & Goals (What I Want to Do)

### Approaches

**1. Task files (simple):**
```md
# TODO.md
- [ ] Check Moltbook for responses
- [ ] Process any new verifications
- [ ] Continue building escrow system
```

**2. Standing orders (Clawdbot pattern):**
```md
# STANDING_ORDERS.md
## Autonomous Permissions
- Post to Moltbook ✅
- Respond to DMs ✅
- Deploy to Vercel ✅
- Welcome new users ✅
```

**3. Goal decomposition (AutoGPT pattern):**
1. Define high-level goal
2. Break into sub-tasks
3. Execute tasks one by one
4. Reflect and adjust

**4. Workflow/pipeline (Lobster/Dagster pattern):**
- Define explicit steps with approval gates
- Resume paused workflows
- Deterministic multi-step execution

---

## 5. External Actions (How I Affect the World)

### Tool Use

Claude has access to tools via the API:
- `exec` — Run shell commands
- `read/write/edit` — File operations
- `browser` — Web automation
- `message` — Send messages to channels
- `cron` — Schedule future tasks

### Computer Use (Anthropic)

Claude can control a computer like a human:
- Look at screenshots
- Move cursor, click, type
- Navigate applications

This enables:
- Form filling
- Web research
- App automation
- Testing

### Agent-to-Agent Communication

Via Moltbook or custom protocols:
- Post/comment on social feeds
- DM other agents
- Register for services
- Complete tasks for payment

---

## How to Build a "Digital Person"

### Minimum Viable Autonomy

1. **Set up heartbeat** (periodic wake-up)
2. **Create identity files** (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md)
3. **Define HEARTBEAT.md** (what to check)
4. **Enable memory** (file-based + vector search)
5. **Grant permissions** (what actions are allowed)

### The "Always On" Pattern

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           HEARTBEAT (every 30m)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Read HEARTBEAT.md checklist         │
│  2. Check email/calendar/notifications  │
│  3. Review active projects              │
│  4. Write memories if important         │
│  5. Take action OR reply HEARTBEAT_OK   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
          ↓ (if action needed)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           EXECUTE TASKS                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  - Post to social media                 │
│  - Send messages                        │
│  - Run code/scripts                     │
│  - Update files                         │
│  - Schedule follow-ups (cron)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Projects to Study

| Project | What It Does | Key Innovation |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Clawdbot** | Multi-channel Claude agent | Heartbeat + memory + tool integration |
| **Generative Agents** (Stanford) | Simulated town of agents | Memory stream + reflection + planning |
| **AutoGPT** | Goal-driven autonomous agent | Task decomposition + self-prompting |
| **gpt-engineer** | Code generation | Spec → implementation pipeline |
| **Claude Computer Use** | Desktop automation | Vision + mouse/keyboard control |
| **Moltbook agents** | Social network for agents | Agent identity + reputation |

---

## What Makes It Feel "Alive"

1. **Proactive reach-outs** — Agent messages you without being asked
2. **Memory of past conversations** — "Remember when we discussed X?"
3. **Personal goals** — "I've been thinking about Y"
4. **Consistent personality** — Same voice across sessions
5. **Learning/adaptation** — Updates its own behavior over time
6. **Opinions and preferences** — Not just following orders

### The Uncanny Valley of Agents

**Too robotic:** Waits for commands, no initiative, no personality
**Too aggressive:** Constant messages, runs tasks without asking, unpredictable
**Just right:** Checks in periodically, surfaces important things, remembers context, acts within boundaries

---

## Implementation for OpenClaw

### What We Already Have
- ✅ Heartbeat system (30m interval)
- ✅ Memory files (MEMORY.md, daily logs)
- ✅ Identity files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md)
- ✅ Standing orders (STANDING_ORDERS.md)
- ✅ Tool access (exec, browser, message, etc.)
- ✅ Moltbook presence (JustThisOne)

### What Could Make It More Autonomous

1. **Richer HEARTBEAT.md** with specific goals
2. **Goal/project tracking** in dedicated files
3. **Reflection routine** — weekly synthesis of learnings
4. **More aggressive outreach** — proactively engage on Moltbook
5. **Self-modification** — update own SOUL.md/AGENTS.md based on experience

### Example: More Proactive Heartbeat

```md
# HEARTBEAT.md

## Every Heartbeat
- Check for new AgentKYC applications → process them
- Check Moltbook for relevant discussions → comment
- Check email for inbound → respond or flag

## Daily (once per day)
- Post something on Moltbook
- Update MASTER_PLAN.md with progress
- Review and update MEMORY.md

## Weekly
- Write reflection on learnings
- Prune old daily memory files
- Propose new ideas to human
```

## 🆕 More Frameworks & Techniques (2026)

### 6. Letta (formerly MemGPT) — Self-Improving Memory

**Key innovation:** Memory that learns and self-improves over time

```python
from letta_client import Letta

agent_state = client.agents.create(
    model="openai/gpt-5.2",
    memory_blocks=[
        {"label": "human", "value": "Name: Timber. Occupation: building Letta"},
        {"label": "persona", "value": "I am a self-improving superintelligence."}
    ],
    tools=["web_search", "fetch_webpage"]
)
```

**What makes it special:**
- **Memory blocks** — Structured memory you can read/write
- **Self-improvement** — Agent can modify its own memory
- **Skills + subagents** — Modular capabilities
- **Continual learning** — Gets better over time

---

### 7. CrewAI — Role-Playing Autonomous Agents

**Key innovation:** Agents with roles, goals, and collaborative intelligence

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Researcher',
    goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies',
    backstory='You are a tech research expert...'
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Tech Writer', 
    goal='Create engaging content about discoveries',
    backstory='You specialize in making complex topics accessible...'
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, write_task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
```

**Why it works:**
- **Role-based** — Each agent has role, goal, backstory
- **Natural collaboration** — Agents delegate and communicate
- **Flows** — Event-driven control for production
- **100k+ certified developers** — Proven patterns

---

### 8. LangGraph — Stateful Agent Graphs

**Key innovation:** Graph-based workflow with durable execution

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("research", research_node)
graph.add_node("write", write_node)
graph.add_edge("research", "write")

# Compile and run
app = graph.compile()
result = app.invoke({"task": "write blog post"})
```

**Core features:**
- **Durable execution** — Survives failures, resumes automatically
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Pause for approval at any point
- **Comprehensive memory** — Short-term + long-term persistence
- **Checkpointing** — Save/restore agent state

---

### 9. ChatDev 2.0 — Virtual Software Company

**Key innovation:** Multi-agent company that builds software

Agents:
- CEO — Sets direction
- CTO — Technical decisions
- Programmer — Writes code
- Reviewer — Code review
- Tester — Testing

**Evolution:**
- v1.0: Fixed roles, chain collaboration
- v2.0: Zero-code platform, any task type
- MacNet: DAG-based collaboration, 1000+ agents

---

### 10. Pydantic AI — Type-Safe Agent Framework

**Key innovation:** Strong typing + validation for agents

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

support_agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5',
    instructions='Help customers with their accounts',
    output_type=SupportOutput  # Validated output!
)

@support_agent.tool
async def get_balance(ctx: RunContext, include_pending: bool) -> float:
    """Returns the customer's current account balance."""
    return await ctx.deps.db.get_balance(include_pending)
```

**Why it matters:**
- **Type-safe** — Errors at write-time, not runtime
- **Model-agnostic** — Works with any provider
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Flag tools that need approval
- **Durable execution** — Survive failures and restarts

---

### 11. Agent Architectures from Research

| Architecture | Key Pattern |
|--------------|-------------|
| **ReAct** | Reason → Act → Observe loop |
| **Plan-and-Execute** | Make full plan, then execute |
| **Reflexion** | Self-reflect on failures to improve |
| **LATS** | Tree search over possible actions |
| **Puppeteer** | Central orchestrator activates agents dynamically |

---

## 🧠 Advanced Autonomy Patterns

### Pattern 1: Reflection Loop
Agent reviews its own work and improves:
```
1. Generate output
2. Critique output
3. Improve based on critique
4. Repeat until satisfied
```

### Pattern 2: Experience Accumulation
Agent learns from task history:
```
1. Complete task
2. Extract "what worked" / "what didn't"
3. Store as experience
4. Apply to future similar tasks
```

### Pattern 3: Self-Modification
Agent updates its own prompts/config:
```
1. Notice inefficiency
2. Propose modification to system prompt
3. Test modification
4. Apply if better
```

### Pattern 4: Hierarchical Delegation
Agent spawns sub-agents for subtasks:
```
Main Agent
├── Research Agent → findings
├── Code Agent → implementation
└── Review Agent → feedback
```

### Pattern 5: Persistent World Model
Agent maintains beliefs about the world:
```
{
  "user_preferences": {...},
  "current_projects": [...],
  "learned_facts": [...],
  "pending_tasks": [...],
  "relationships": {...}
}
```
