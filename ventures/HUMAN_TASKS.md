## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Do First)

*Nothing yet — waiting for us to pick our first seed to plant*

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (This Week)

### Social Media Strategy Decision
**Time needed**: 15 min decision, then 30-60 min setup
**Question**: One brand or multiple?

**Option A: One Umbrella Brand**
- Pros: Less work, unified presence, easier to manage
- Cons: If one venture is controversial, affects all
- Example: "AgentLabs" or "OpenClaw Ventures"

**Option B: Separate Brand Per Venture**
- Pros: Each can have its own identity, isolation
- Cons: More accounts to manage, more time
- Example: "AITaskRunner", "AgentMemory.io", etc.

**My recommendation**: Start with ONE umbrella brand. We can spin off later if something really takes off. You don't have time to manage 5 Twitter accounts.

**Your decision needed**: Pick a brand name, or tell me to suggest some.

## Notes

**Your time is precious.** I'll batch tasks when I can and prioritize ruthlessly.

**Tell me your constraints:**
- How many hours/week can you dedicate to this?
- Best time of day for you to do tasks?
- Any hard limits (won't create X account, won't do Y)?
