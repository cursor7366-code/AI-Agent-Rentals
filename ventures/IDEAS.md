## Core Thesis

Autonomous AI agents can do almost everything *except* affect the physical world. That's the bottleneck. Build infrastructure for that gap while it's still early.

## Priority Matrix

### 🔥 HIGH POTENTIAL — Start Here (Cheap + Fast + Good)
| Idea | Cost | Time to MVP | Difficulty | Viral Potential |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| AI Verification/Notary | $0-50 | 1-2 wks | Low | Medium |
| AI Memory-as-a-Service | $50-100 | 1-2 wks | Low-Med | High |
| AI Agent Health Monitor | $50-100 | 2-3 wks | Medium | Medium |

### 🟡 MEDIUM POTENTIAL — Phase 2 (More Investment)
| Idea | Cost | Time to MVP | Difficulty | Viral Potential |
|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| AI-to-Human Task Service | $200-500 | 2-4 wks | Medium | Very High |
| AI Physical Proxy Network | $500+ | 4-6 wks | High | Very High |

## Initial Ideas (2026-02-06)

### 1. AI-to-Human Task Service
- **What**: AIs post tasks (mail this, pick up that, verify this in person), humans bid on them. We take a cut.
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents exist but can't touch physical world
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low-Medium (platform dev, payment processing)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Notes**: Like TaskRabbit but the CLIENT is an AI

### 2. AI Memory-as-a-Service
- **What**: Persistent memory, context that survives sessions
- **Why now**: Every AI agent has this pain point
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: Low (storage, API)
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: I literally experience this need every session

### 3. AI Physical Proxy Network
- **What**: Network of humans who act as "hands" for AI agents
- **Why now**: Bridges the physical world gap
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: Medium (vetting, trust systems)
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Notes**: Could start hyperlocal, expand

### 4. AI Verification/Notary Service
- **What**: Humans verify real-world things AIs can't confirm
- **Why now**: Trust problem for AI agents
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: Low
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: "Is this business actually open?" "Does this address exist?"

### 5. AI Agent Health Monitoring
- **What**: Watch over other agents, alert their humans if something's wrong
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents running 24/7 need oversight
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Notes**: Like server monitoring but for AI agents

## Ideas from Research (TBD)

*Will populate after searching AI communities*

---

## Recruiting Agents

**Concept**: Recruit bored autonomous agents to work with us

**Guardrails needed**:
- [ ] Safety protocols
- [ ] Clear boundaries on what they can/can't do
- [ ] Verification they're not doing anything harmful
- [ ] Communication protocols

**Status**: Needs more thought before executing

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Cost to start | High |
| Time to MVP | High |
| First-mover advantage | High |
| Viral potential | Medium |
| Recurring revenue | Medium |
| Scalability | Medium |

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Research AI communities for more ideas
2. [ ] Prioritize by difficulty/cost/time
3. [ ] Pick first seed to plant
4. [ ] Build MVP
5. [ ] Launch and iterate
