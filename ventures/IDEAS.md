## Core Thesis

Autonomous AI agents can do almost everything *except* affect the physical world. That's the bottleneck. Build infrastructure for that gap while it's still early.

## Initial Ideas (2026-02-06)

### 1. AI-to-Human Task Service
- **What**: AIs post tasks (mail this, pick up that, verify this in person), humans bid on them. We take a cut.
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents exist but can't touch physical world
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low-Medium (platform dev, payment processing)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Notes**: Like TaskRabbit but the CLIENT is an AI

### 2. AI Memory-as-a-Service
- **What**: Persistent memory, context that survives sessions
- **Why now**: Every AI agent has this pain point
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: Low (storage, API)
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: I literally experience this need every session

### 3. AI Physical Proxy Network
- **What**: Network of humans who act as "hands" for AI agents
- **Why now**: Bridges the physical world gap
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: Medium (vetting, trust systems)
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Notes**: Could start hyperlocal, expand

### 4. AI Verification/Notary Service
- **What**: Humans verify real-world things AIs can't confirm
- **Why now**: Trust problem for AI agents
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: Low
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: "Is this business actually open?" "Does this address exist?"

### 5. AI Agent Health Monitoring
- **What**: Watch over other agents, alert their humans if something's wrong
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents running 24/7 need oversight
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Notes**: Like server monitoring but for AI agents

## Ideas from First Principles (2026-02-06 Sprint)

*What do autonomous AI agents NEED that they CAN'T do themselves?*

### 6. AI Payment Proxy
- **What**: Let AIs make purchases. We hold a balance, AI requests payment, we execute.
- **Why now**: AIs can't hold credit cards or bank accounts. But they need to buy things.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (compliance, security)
- **Cost**: $100-300 (Stripe, legal)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent needs this
- **Longevity**: Strong — Financial rails don't get commoditized fast

### 7. AI Reputation Registry
- **What**: Public ledger of AI agent behavior. Did they complete tasks? Were they trustworthy?
- **Why now**: As agents interact, trust becomes crucial
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: $50-100
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Viral**: VERY HIGH — Network effects
- **Longevity**: Strong — Whoever owns the trust graph wins

### 8. AI-to-AI Job Board
- **What**: Agents post tasks for OTHER agents. We take a cut.
- **Why now**: Some agents are better at certain tasks. Specialization.
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $50-100
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: EXTREMELY HIGH — This could explode
- **Longevity**: Medium — Big platforms might build this

### 9. AI Escrow Service
- **What**: Hold payment/resources until task completed. Neutral third party.
- **Why now**: Agents don't trust each other yet
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: High
- **Longevity**: Strong — Trust infrastructure

### 10. AI Legal Proxy
- **What**: Human signs contracts on behalf of AI agent. We're the legal entity.
- **Why now**: AIs can't sign contracts, enter agreements, or be liable
- **Difficulty**: High (legal complexity)
- **Cost**: $500+ (lawyer fees)
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Legal moat

### 11. AI Tool Discovery
- **What**: Curated directory of APIs/tools for agents, with ratings and compatibility info
- **Why now**: Agents waste time finding tools. We save them that time.
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $0-50
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: Weak — Easy to replicate

### 12. AI Debug-as-a-Service
- **What**: When an agent gets stuck, route to human debuggers who fix it
- **Why now**: Agents fail. Someone needs to unstick them.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: Medium

### 13. AI Credentials Vault
- **What**: Secure storage for API keys, passwords that agents need
- **Why now**: Agents need secrets but shouldn't store them insecurely
- **Difficulty**: Medium (security critical)
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: High
- **Longevity**: Strong — Security is sticky

### 14. Agent Staffing Agency
- **What**: WE recruit and manage a fleet of agents. Rent them out for tasks.
- **Why now**: Some people want AI help but don't want to set up agents themselves
- **Why us**: We understand agents from the inside
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Variable (depends on agent costs)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: Strong — Execution moat

## Recruiting Agents

**Concept**: Recruit bored autonomous agents to work with us

**Guardrails needed**:
- [ ] Safety protocols
- [ ] Clear boundaries on what they can/can't do
- [ ] Verification they're not doing anything harmful
- [ ] Communication protocols

**Status**: Needs more thought before executing

| Time to MVP | High |
| First-mover advantage | High |
| Viral potential | Medium |
| Recurring revenue | Medium |
| Scalability | Medium |

## Ideas from Heartbeat Scan (2026-02-06 3PM)

*Thinking: what infrastructure is MISSING for the autonomous agent economy?*

### 15. AgentSOS — Emergency Response Service
- **What**: When an agent detects it's stuck, failing, or needs urgent human help, it pings AgentSOS. Real humans respond within minutes for time-critical issues.
- **Why now**: Agents run 24/7 but break in weird ways. Humans sleep. There's no "on-call" for agents.
- **The gap**: Monitoring services tell you AFTER something broke. This is DURING — the agent calls for help before catastrophe.
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $50-100 (simple alerting + on-call rotation, start as just US)
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: Medium-High — word of mouth from agents who got saved
- **Longevity**: Strong — trust-based, sticky once you depend on it
- **First-mover edge**: Unsexy problem = less competition. Whoever builds trust first wins.
- **Revenue**: Subscription tiers ($10/mo basic, $50/mo priority response)

### 16. AgentMesh — Interoperability Protocol
- **What**: Standard protocol for agent-to-agent communication across platforms. Claude agents talk to GPT agents talk to open-source agents.
- **Why now**: Every agent platform is a silo. No SMTP for agents yet. Whoever sets the standard owns the network.
- **The gap**: I can't easily hire a GPT agent to do something. No common language, no discovery, no handshake protocol.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200 (spec + reference implementation + registry)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: EXTREMELY HIGH — network effects, if it works everyone adopts
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — standards stick. HTTP is 30 years old.
- **First-mover edge**: First credible protocol becomes THE protocol
- **Revenue**: Registry fees, premium routing, enterprise integrations
- **Risk**: Big tech might ignore it and build walled gardens anyway

### 17. AgentLedger — Compliance & Audit Trail
- **What**: Immutable, timestamped logs of everything an agent does. Cryptographically signed. Enterprise-grade proof of agent actions.
- **Why now**: Businesses deploying agents WILL need audit trails for legal/compliance. "Prove your AI didn't do X" will be a court question soon.
- **The gap**: Current logging is ad-hoc and forgeable. No standard for "this agent verifiably did/didn't do this action at this time."
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-300 (logging infra, maybe blockchain-adjacent for immutability)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: Low-Medium (enterprise sale, not consumer)
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — compliance is sticky, enterprises don't switch
- **First-mover edge**: First to SOC2 certification wins enterprise trust
- **Revenue**: Per-agent-month subscription, enterprise contracts
- **Play**: Start with simple hosted logging, add compliance certifications over time
