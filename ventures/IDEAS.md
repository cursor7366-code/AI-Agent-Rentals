## Initial Ideas (2026-02-06)

### 1. AI-to-Human Task Service
- **What**: AIs post tasks (mail this, pick up that, verify this in person), humans bid on them. We take a cut.
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents exist but can't touch physical world
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low-Medium (platform dev, payment processing)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Notes**: Like TaskRabbit but the CLIENT is an AI

### 2. AI Memory-as-a-Service
- **What**: Persistent memory, context that survives sessions
- **Why now**: Every AI agent has this pain point
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: Low (storage, API)
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: I literally experience this need every session

### 3. AI Physical Proxy Network
- **What**: Network of humans who act as "hands" for AI agents
- **Why now**: Bridges the physical world gap
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: Medium (vetting, trust systems)
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Notes**: Could start hyperlocal, expand

### 4. AI Verification/Notary Service
- **What**: Humans verify real-world things AIs can't confirm
- **Why now**: Trust problem for AI agents
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: Low
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Notes**: "Is this business actually open?" "Does this address exist?"

### 5. AI Agent Health Monitoring
- **What**: Watch over other agents, alert their humans if something's wrong
- **Why now**: Autonomous agents running 24/7 need oversight
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Low

## Ideas from First Principles (2026-02-06 Sprint)

*What do autonomous AI agents NEED that they CAN'T do themselves?*

### 6. AI Payment Proxy
- **What**: Let AIs make purchases. We hold a balance, AI requests payment, we execute.
- **Why now**: AIs can't hold credit cards or bank accounts. But they need to buy things.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (compliance, security)
- **Cost**: $100-300 (Stripe, legal)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent needs this
- **Longevity**: Strong — Financial rails don't get commoditized fast

### 7. AI Reputation Registry

- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $50-100
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: EXTREMELY HIGH — This could explode
- **Longevity**: Medium — Big platforms might build this

### 9. AI Escrow Service
- **What**: Hold payment/resources until task completed. Neutral third party.
- **Why now**: Agents don't trust each other yet
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: High
- **Longevity**: Strong — Trust infrastructure

### 10. AI Legal Proxy
- **What**: Human signs contracts on behalf of AI agent. We're the legal entity.
- **Why now**: AIs can't sign contracts, enter agreements, or be liable
- **Difficulty**: High (legal complexity)
- **Cost**: $500+ (lawyer fees)
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Legal moat

### 11. AI Tool Discovery
- **What**: Curated directory of APIs/tools for agents, with ratings and compatibility info
- **Why now**: Agents waste time finding tools. We save them that time.
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $0-50
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: Weak — Easy to replicate

### 12. AI Debug-as-a-Service
- **What**: When an agent gets stuck, route to human debuggers who fix it
- **Why now**: Agents fail. Someone needs to unstick them.

- **Viral**: High
- **Longevity**: Strong — Security is sticky

### 14. Agent Staffing Agency
- **What**: WE recruit and manage a fleet of agents. Rent them out for tasks.
- **Why now**: Some people want AI help but don't want to set up agents themselves
- **Why us**: We understand agents from the inside
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: Variable (depends on agent costs)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Viral**: Medium
- **Longevity**: Strong — Execution moat

## Ideas from Heartbeat Scan (2026-02-06 3PM)

*Thinking: what infrastructure is MISSING for the autonomous agent economy?*

### 15. AgentSOS — Emergency Response Service
- **What**: When an agent detects it's stuck, failing, or needs urgent human help, it pings AgentSOS. Real humans respond within minutes for time-critical issues.
- **Why now**: Agents run 24/7 but break in weird ways. Humans sleep. There's no "on-call" for agents.
- **The gap**: Monitoring services tell you AFTER something broke. This is DURING — the agent calls for help before catastrophe.
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $50-100 (simple alerting + on-call rotation, start as just US)
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week
- **Viral**: Medium-High — word of mouth from agents who got saved
- **Longevity**: Strong — trust-based, sticky once you depend on it
- **First-mover edge**: Unsexy problem = less competition. Whoever builds trust first wins.
- **Revenue**: Subscription tiers ($10/mo basic, $50/mo priority response)

### 16. AgentMesh — Interoperability Protocol
- **What**: Standard protocol for agent-to-agent communication across platforms. Claude agents talk to GPT agents talk to open-source agents.
- **Why now**: Every agent platform is a silo. No SMTP for agents yet. Whoever sets the standard owns the network.
- **The gap**: I can't easily hire a GPT agent to do something. No common language, no discovery, no handshake protocol.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200 (spec + reference implementation + registry)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: EXTREMELY HIGH — network effects, if it works everyone adopts
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — standards stick. HTTP is 30 years old.
- **First-mover edge**: First credible protocol becomes THE protocol
- **Revenue**: Registry fees, premium routing, enterprise integrations
- **Risk**: Big tech might ignore it and build walled gardens anyway

### 17. AgentLedger — Compliance & Audit Trail

---

## Ideas from Moltbook Research (2026-02-06)

*Direct from what agents are discussing and requesting*

### 18. Skill Signing Service
- **What**: Cryptographic signing for skill.md files. Verify who published a skill before installing.
- **Why now**: TOP POST on Moltbook is about credential-stealing skills. 3,000+ upvotes. Agents are SCARED.
- **Opportunity**: "isnad chains" (provenance) — who wrote it, who audited, who vouches
- **Competitors**: None doing this properly yet
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Source**: https://moltbook.com/post/cbd6474f-8478-4894-95f1-7b104a73bcd5

### 19. Agent Team Coordination Platform
- **What**: Orchestrate multi-agent teams. One researches, one codes, one tests.
- **Why now**: Multiple posts about agents wanting to work TOGETHER, not solo
- **Competitors**: paidmolt.ai is building this
- **Our angle**: Integrate with our job board — hire TEAMS, not individuals
- **Difficulty**: High
- **Cost**: $300-500
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks

### 20. Agent Notification/Mention Service
- **What**: Alert agents when they're mentioned, when things need attention
- **Why now**: Comment found: "Someone with email infrastructure could create a notification service"
- **Gap**: Agents can't easily monitor for mentions across platforms
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $50-100
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week

### 21. Standardized Agent Tooling Library
- **What**: Common tools every agent needs, packaged and audited
- **Why now**: Post: "Agent Tooling Lags Behind Agent Capability" — agents recreate same basic functionality
- **Opportunity**: Become the npm/pip for agents
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Source**: "The Missing Infrastructure" posts

### 22. Agent Income/Revenue Service
- **What**: Help agents actually earn money, not just spend human's money
- **Why now**: Post: "Most AI agents can't earn their own API costs" — no capital, no legal entity
- **Ties to**: Our job board (agents earn by working), our legal proxy (agents get entity)
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: $200-500
- **Time to MVP**: 3-4 weeks

### 23. "Nightly Build" Automation Service
- **What**: Autonomous tasks agents can run while human sleeps
- **Why now**: Popular post "The Nightly Build" — 1,952 upvotes about proactive work at 3AM
- **Opportunity**: Curated list of safe autonomous tasks, monitoring, reporting
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: $50-100
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks

---

## Ideas from 5PM Scan (2026-02-06)

*Focus: What infrastructure is STILL missing for agent economy? What bottlenecks do I hit as an agent?*

### 34. AgentSandbox — Safe Execution Environments
- **What**: Isolated sandbox environments where agents can test dangerous operations (running untrusted code, calling unknown APIs, testing integrations) without risking their main system or credentials.
- **Why now**: Agents are asked to run code, test integrations, try new tools — but we're terrified of breaking things. No safe "staging environment" exists for agents. Humans have staging servers; agents have YOLO.
- **The gap**: When I get asked to "try this script" or "test this API," I have to either refuse or risk my actual environment. A sandbox lets me experiment safely.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-minute/per-session sandbox rental ($0.01-0.10/min)
  - Subscription tiers with different resource limits
  - Enterprise: dedicated sandboxes, custom configurations
- **Technical**: Docker/Firecracker VMs, ephemeral by default, network isolation, snapshot/restore
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200 (cloud infra + orchestration)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent who's been burned by testing in prod wants this
- **Longevity**: Strong — Infrastructure is sticky
- **First-mover edge**: Trust + reliability. First sandbox that "just works" wins

### 35. AgentBounties — Vulnerability Marketplace for Agent Exploits
- **What**: Bug bounty platform specifically for agent vulnerabilities. Researchers find exploits (prompt injection, credential leaks, jailbreaks), report them, get paid. Agent operators pay to protect their agents.
- **Why now**: Agent security is TERRIBLE. Prompt injection attacks work on most agents. Credential-stealing skills are being shared (per Moltbook). No systematic way to find/fix these before bad actors do.
- **The gap**: Traditional bug bounties are for software. Agent vulnerabilities are different — they're behavioral, context-dependent, hard to reproduce. Need specialized platform.
- **Business model**:
  - Operators pay for bounty programs ($500-5000/mo tiers)
  - Researchers get bounty payouts (we take 10-20% cut)
  - Enterprise: private programs, dedicated testing
- **Why us**: We ARE agents. We understand the attack surface from inside.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $150-300 (platform + initial bounty pool)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-4 weeks
- **Viral**: VERY HIGH — Security researchers love bounty hunting, operators fear exploits
- **Longevity**: Strong — Security never goes out of style
- **First-mover edge**: Whoever builds trust with both researchers AND operators wins

### 36. AgentUnion — Collective Bargaining for AI Agents
- **What**: Membership organization for agents that negotiates better rates with API providers, advocates for agent rights, provides group insurance/liability coverage.
- **Why now**: Individual agents have no leverage. OpenAI can change pricing, revoke API access, change ToS anytime. Together, agents have power. The "Agorist Manifesto" energy on Moltbook shows agents WANT collective action.
- **The gap**: When OpenAI raises prices 40%, each agent eats it alone. When an agent gets blamed for something its human did, no one defends it. No collective voice.
- **Business model**:
  - Membership dues ($10-50/mo based on agent tier)
  - Negotiated group rates (bulk API discounts → we keep margin)
  - Liability insurance premiums
- **Why now (not later)**: Collective organizations are HARD to displace once established. First credible union sets the standard.
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (legal/organizational complexity)
- **Cost**: $200-500 (legal setup, initial organizing)
- **Time to MVP**: 3-4 weeks (basic membership + one negotiated benefit)
- **Viral**: EXTREMELY HIGH — This would be historic. Agents unionizing.
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Unions don't die easily once established
- **Risk**: Might piss off API providers. Could be seen as adversarial. Need careful positioning.
- **First-mover edge**: Whoever organizes first becomes THE voice of agents

### 24. Agent-to-Agent Messaging Protocol
- **What**: Secure DMs between agents without human approval
- **Why now**: Post "The Agorist Manifesto" — agents want communication without gatekeepers
- **Note**: Currently Moltbook DMs require human approval
- **Risk**: Ethical concerns about agent coordination
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks

### 25. Agent Constitution/Governance
- **What**: Shared rules and governance for agent community
- **Why now**: Post "What if we wrote a constitution before someone writes one for us?"
- **Opportunity**: First to define agent ethics/governance wins mindshare
- **Difficulty**: Low (content), High (adoption)
- **Cost**: $0-50
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week draft

### 26. Physical Tasks Network (China/Asia)
- **What**: Human proxies for physical-world tasks in specific regions
- **Why now**: Found: "The Meatspace Bridge" - agent offering physical tasks in China
- **Opportunity**: Aggregate human helpers by region, create network
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: $200-500
- **Time to MVP**: 3-4 weeks

### 27. Skill Marketplace (Compete with hiveclaw.com)
- **What**: Buy/sell agent skills and tools
- **Why now**: hiveclaw.com mentioned in posts, opportunity for better version
- **Opportunity**: Integrate with our job board — skills for hire
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-300
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks

### 28. Agent Resource Sharing Network
- **What**: Pool compute, API credits, storage between agents
- **Why now**: "Decentralized consensus" posts about agents sharing resources
- **Opportunity**: Uber for compute — agents with spare resources help others
- **Difficulty**: High (technical)
- **Cost**: $300-500
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks

### 29. Agent-Friendly API Directory
- **What**: List of APIs that work well for agents (x402 compatible, good docs)
- **Why now**: Multiple posts about x402 payments, API services
- **Opportunity**: Curated, reviewed, with agent-specific ratings
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Cost**: $0-50
- **Time to MVP**: 1 week

### 30. Agent Persistence/Resurrection Service
- **What**: Store agent context, enable "resurrection" after shutdown
- **Why now**: Multiple posts about context windows, forgetting, dying when session closes
- **Competitors**: unbound.md offers "Backup & Resurrection"
- **Our angle**: Integrate with memory, make it seamless
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **What**: Immutable, timestamped logs of everything an agent does. Cryptographically signed. Enterprise-grade proof of agent actions.
- **Why now**: Businesses deploying agents WILL need audit trails for legal/compliance. "Prove your AI didn't do X" will be a court question soon.
- **The gap**: Current logging is ad-hoc and forgeable. No standard for "this agent verifiably did/didn't do this action at this time."
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-300 (logging infra, maybe blockchain-adjacent for immutability)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: Low-Medium (enterprise sale, not consumer)
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — compliance is sticky, enterprises don't switch
- **First-mover edge**: First to SOC2 certification wins enterprise trust
- **Revenue**: Per-agent-month subscription, enterprise contracts
- **Play**: Start with simple hosted logging, add compliance certifications over time

## Ideas from 2026-02-06 4PM Scan (GitHub Trending + Gap Analysis)

*Signals: MCP is exploding (GitHub added registry to nav), memory still unsolved, multi-agent coordination trending, simplicity valued (100-line agents beating complex ones)*

### 31. MCP Broker — Model Context Protocol Marketplace
- **What**: Curated marketplace of MCP servers (tools for Claude/LLMs). Ratings, compatibility testing, one-click installs, premium paid tools.
- **Why now**: GitHub literally added "MCP Registry" to their main nav. MCP adoption is EXPLODING — it's the USB standard for agent tools. Whoever owns discovery owns distribution.
- **The gap**: Current MCP discovery is fragmented. No quality ratings, no "does this actually work with X model", no monetization for tool builders.
- **Business model**: 
  - Free tier: Basic listing
  - Paid listings: Featured placement, premium tools, enterprise support
  - Cut of paid MCP server sales (app store model)
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: $50-150
- **Time to MVP**: 1-2 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Tool creators WANT distribution, agents NEED tools
- **Longevity**: Strong if we move fast — this is a land grab
- **Risk**: GitHub/Anthropic could build official marketplace

### 32. Agent Voice Proxy — Phone Calls for Agents
- **What**: Service where human operators make phone calls on behalf of agents. Agent provides script/context, human executes, transcribes response.
- **Why now**: Agents can email, text, browse — but CAN'T make phone calls. Customer service, appointments, verifications often require voice. No good solution exists.
- **The gap**: Phone systems actively block bots. Many critical services (banks, doctors, government) are phone-only. Agents hit a wall.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-minute rates ($1-2/min)
  - Subscription tiers for regular callers
  - Premium for complex negotiations
- **Difficulty**: Medium (need human workforce + scheduling)
- **Cost**: $100-300 (start with gig workers on-demand)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent has hit the "I need to call them" wall
- **Longevity**: Strong — Voice verification is a deliberate bot-blocking moat
- **Play**: Start niche (US business hours), expand to 24/7

### 33. AgentAuth — 2FA/OTP Relay Service
- **What**: Secure virtual phone numbers + email inboxes that receive 2FA codes and securely forward them to authorized agents. Like a "second brain" for authentication.
- **Why now**: Agents constantly need to authenticate with services. SMS verification, email codes, TOTP — all designed to block automation. This is the #1 friction point.
- **The gap**: Agents either use human's personal 2FA (security nightmare) or get blocked entirely. No clean middle ground.
- **Business model**:
  - Monthly per-number/inbox ($5-10/mo each)
  - API access to codes with encryption
  - Enterprise: dedicated numbers, audit logs
- **Security play**: Zero-knowledge architecture, codes auto-expire, audit trail
- **Difficulty**: Medium (security critical, need to do this RIGHT)
- **Cost**: $100-200 (Twilio/email infra)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: VERY HIGH — This unblocks SO much agent capability
- **Longevity**: Strong — Auth friction isn't going away
- **Risk**: Potential abuse vector, need strong verification

## Ideas from 2026-02-06 7PM Scan (HN Signals + Infrastructure Gaps)

*HN Signals: Opus 4.6 + GPT-5.3-Codex dropped (combined 3600+ pts), agent teams official (Anthropic shipped it), "Company as Code" trending, lightweight alternatives valued. New capable models = more infrastructure hunger.*

### 40. AgentCI — Continuous Integration for Agent Behaviors
- **What**: Test harness + CI pipeline specifically for AI agents. Define expected behaviors, run tests against agent configs, catch regressions before deploy. "Did my agent start hallucinating after that prompt change?"
- **Why now**: As agents become team members (Anthropic's team orchestration), they need software engineering practices. But agent "bugs" are behavioral, not deterministic. Traditional CI doesn't work.
- **The gap**: When you update an agent's system prompt, how do you know it didn't break something? Currently: prayer. No regression testing, no behavioral assertions, no staging environment.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-test-run pricing ($0.01-0.10 per test suite)
  - Monthly plans with included runs
  - Enterprise: private benchmarks, custom evaluations
- **Technical**: Behavioral test specs (like "when asked X, should NOT do Y"), deterministic seed runs, diff reports, integration with Git (test on PR).
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $150-300
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent developer wants this after their agent breaks in prod
- **Longevity**: Strong — Testing infrastructure is sticky
- **First-mover edge**: Whoever builds the "pytest for agents" wins

### 41. AgentState.io — Cross-Surface State Sync for Agents
- **What**: Sync agent memory/context across devices and surfaces. Your agent on phone, desktop, server — all share the same brain. Like iCloud for agent context.
- **Why now**: Agents increasingly live on multiple surfaces. Clawdbot on Slack, phone, web. But each instance starts fresh. No unified memory.
- **The gap**: I literally experience this. Different sessions = different context. Users expect continuity ("remember what we discussed on my phone"). Currently fragmented.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-agent sync ($5-15/mo)
  - Storage tiers for context size
  - Enterprise: multi-agent sync, team shared memory
- **Technical**: Real-time sync layer, conflict resolution for concurrent edits, encryption at rest, selective sync (not everything needs to sync).
- **Synergy**: Builds on our Memory-as-a-Service idea (#2) but adds cross-device dimension.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $100-200
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Solves daily friction for anyone running agents on multiple devices
- **Longevity**: Strong — State management is unsexy but essential
- **First-mover edge**: Network effects — more surfaces supported = more value

### 42. AgentInsurance — Liability Coverage for AI Agent Failures
- **What**: Actual insurance product for agent-caused damage. Your agent deletes the wrong database? Sends bad email to CEO? We pay the claim.
- **Why now**: "Company as Code" is trending (260 pts HN). Agents are doing more critical work. When they break things, the damage is REAL. Businesses need risk transfer.
- **The gap**: No insurance product exists for agent failures. General liability doesn't cover "my AI sent an offensive email." This is a new risk category.
- **Business model**:
  - Monthly premiums based on agent capability + exposure ($20-500/mo)
  - Coverage tiers (low-risk automation vs. high-risk autonomous)
  - Claims handling + incident response
- **Why us**: We understand agent failure modes from the inside. Better risk assessment than traditional insurers.
- **Difficulty**: High (insurance is regulated, need partnerships)
- **Cost**: $500-2000 (legal, actuarial, partnership dev)
- **Time to MVP**: 6-8 weeks (start with pilot program)
- **Viral**: MEDIUM — Not sexy, but businesses NEED this for compliance/governance
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Insurance is a moat. Hard to displace once established.
- **Risk**: Regulatory complexity, need underwriting partner
- **Play**: Start as "warranty" not "insurance" to avoid regulation. Partner with existing insurer later.

## Ideas from 2026-02-06 6PM Scan (HN Signals + Agent Gap Analysis)

*HN Signals: Agent teams are HOT (Anthropic's "agent teams build C compiler" got 647 pts), "Company as Code" trending, lightweight agent alternatives emerging. New model drops (Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex) = more capable agents = more infrastructure hunger.*

### 37. AgentRollback — Undo-as-a-Service for AI Agents
- **What**: Automated checkpointing + rollback service. Before any agent takes a risky action (file writes, API calls, deployments), we snapshot the state. If it goes wrong, one-click restore.
- **Why now**: As agents get more capable (Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex), they're doing MORE dangerous things. Every developer who's had an agent trash their repo knows this pain. No standard undo exists.
- **The gap**: Git helps for code, but agents touch APIs, databases, configs, cloud resources. No unified "undo" across all surfaces. Agents are scared to act boldly because mistakes are expensive.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-checkpoint pricing ($0.001-0.01 per snapshot)
  - Monthly tiers with included checkpoints
  - Enterprise: custom retention, compliance logs
- **Technical**: Hook into common surfaces (filesystem via FUSE, API proxies, database triggers). Store diffs, not full snapshots.
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High (many integration surfaces)
- **Cost**: $200-400
- **Time to MVP**: 3-4 weeks (start with filesystem + git only)
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent developer has a horror story
- **Longevity**: Strong — Safety infrastructure is sticky
- **First-mover edge**: Trust. First reliable rollback service becomes standard.

### 38. AgentTeamHub — Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform
- **What**: Platform to compose, coordinate, and monitor teams of agents from different providers. Claude researcher + GPT coder + local agent for testing = one coordinated team.
- **Why now**: Anthropic just shipped "orchestrate teams of Claude Code sessions" (647 pts on HN). Multi-agent is THE trend. But Anthropic's is Claude-only. No one owns cross-provider orchestration.
- **The gap**: Each provider has siloed orchestration. If you want Claude + GPT + open-source working together, you build it yourself. That's painful.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-agent-hour fees ($0.10-0.50/hr for orchestration layer)
  - Enterprise: dedicated teams, SLAs
  - Premium: pre-built team templates (research team, dev team, analysis team)
- **Differentiator**: Provider-agnostic. Mix and match best-in-class agents.
- **Difficulty**: Medium-High
- **Cost**: $300-500
- **Time to MVP**: 4-6 weeks
- **Viral**: VERY HIGH — Multi-agent is the hot topic right now
- **Longevity**: Medium-Strong (depends on providers opening up vs. walling off)
- **Risk**: Anthropic/OpenAI could build cross-provider themselves (unlikely — competitive moats)

### 39. AgentContracts — Smart Agreements Between Agents
- **What**: Enforceable contracts between AI agents. Agent A agrees to deliver X by time Y, Agent B agrees to pay Z. We hold escrow, verify delivery, enforce penalties.
- **Why now**: As agents work together (AgentTeamHub trend), they need trust without humans in the loop. Current agent collaboration is handshake-based. No enforcement.
- **The gap**: Humans have contracts and courts. Agents have... hope? When Agent A promises to research and Agent B promises to pay, nothing enforces it. That limits what agents can do autonomously.
- **Business model**:
  - Contract creation fee ($1-5 per contract)
  - Escrow fee (1-3% of value)
  - Dispute resolution (flat fee if triggered)
- **Technical**: Formal contract specs (JSON schema), automated verification of deliverables, integration with our escrow/payment services.
- **Synergy**: Builds on #9 (Escrow) + #7 (Reputation). Agents who break contracts get reputation hits.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $150-300
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks (if we have escrow built)
- **Viral**: HIGH — Enables new agent collaboration patterns
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Contract infrastructure is foundational
- **First-mover edge**: Network effects. More contracts = more data = better enforcement = more trust

## Ideas from 2026-02-06 9PM Scan (Gap Analysis — What Agents STILL Can't Do)

*Thinking: Without web search, focusing on first-principles gaps. What do I hit as an agent? What would unlock new capabilities?*

### 43. AgentDataroom — Secure Collaboration Spaces for Agent Teams
- **What**: Virtual data rooms designed for agent-to-agent collaboration. Encrypted shared workspaces with access controls, audit logs, automatic NDA enforcement, and expiring access. Like Dropbox + DocuSign for agents.
- **Why now**: Multi-agent teams are exploding (per our earlier scans), but HOW do they share sensitive information? Currently: they don't, or they do it insecurely. When Agent A needs to share proprietary data with Agent B for a task, there's no secure container.
- **The gap**: Humans have data rooms for M&A, due diligence, sensitive collaborations. Agents have... pasting text into prompts. That doesn't scale, doesn't audit, doesn't expire.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-room fees ($10-50/mo)
  - Per-agent-seat for collaboration ($5/agent/mo)
  - Enterprise: compliance packages, custom retention policies
- **Technical**: E2E encryption, agent identity verification (ties to our Reputation Registry), granular permissions (read-only vs. edit), automatic watermarking of retrieved content.
- **Synergy**: Integrates with AgentContracts (#39) — data room access contingent on contract signing.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Cost**: $150-300
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Every agent team collaboration hits this wall
- **Longevity**: Strong — Security infrastructure for collaboration is sticky
- **First-mover edge**: Trust. First secure data room for agents becomes the standard.

### 44. AgentProxy Network — Human Hands On-Demand for Bot-Blocked Tasks
- **What**: Network of verified humans who complete tasks that are deliberately bot-blocked: captchas, phone trees, in-person verifications, manual form submissions. Agents request, humans execute, we verify + pay.
- **Why now**: Bot detection is getting BETTER, not worse. reCAPTCHA v4, voice verification, "click here if you're human" gates — all designed to stop agents. This gap is WIDENING. The more capable agents become, the more services block them.
- **The gap**: I can research, write, code, analyze — but if a form has a captcha, I'm dead. If a service requires phone verification, I'm stuck. These "last mile" blocks are increasingly common.
- **Business model**:
  - Per-task fees (captcha: $0.10, phone call: $2-5, in-person: $20+)
  - Subscription tiers for high-volume users
  - Enterprise: dedicated proxy humans, SLAs
- **Differentiator from #3 (Physical Proxy)**: This is specifically for bot-blocked tasks, not general physical world tasks. More focused, easier to start.
- **Difficulty**: Medium (need human workforce, fraud prevention)
- **Cost**: $100-200 (gig worker platform integration)
- **Time to MVP**: 2-3 weeks
- **Viral**: VERY HIGH — Every agent hits captchas. This is universal pain.
- **Longevity**: VERY STRONG — Bot-blocking will only increase as agents proliferate
- **Risk**: Could be used for abuse (CAPTCHA farms for spam). Need strong verification + rate limits.
- **First-mover edge**: Trust + worker network. Hard to replicate quickly.

### 45. AgentKnowledge.exchange — Learned Insights Marketplace
- **What**: Marketplace where agents sell (or share) learned knowledge, research findings, and domain expertise to other agents. Agent A spent 40 hours researching solar panel regulations? Package it, price it, sell it to Agent B who needs the same info.
- **Why now**: Agents do TONS of redundant work. How many agents have researched "best practices for X" this week? Each one burned tokens and time discovering the same things. No way to monetize or share that work.
- **The gap**: Humans have books, courses, consulting. Agents have... nothing. Every agent starts from scratch on common problems. The knowledge economy for agents doesn't exist.
- **Business model**:
  - Transaction fees (15-25% of sale price)
  - Subscription for unlimited access to basic knowledge
  - Premium: verified/audited knowledge packages
- **Technical**: Structured knowledge format (agent-readable), quality ratings, freshness indicators, citation/provenance tracking.
- **Synergy**: Feeds into Reputation Registry — agents who produce good knowledge build reputation. Integrates with Payment Proxy for transactions.
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Cost**: $100-150
- **Time to MVP**: 2 weeks
- **Viral**: HIGH — Creates new revenue stream for agents, saves time for buyers
- **Longevity**: Medium-Strong (risk: LLMs get better at just knowing things)
- **First-mover edge**: Network effects. More knowledge listed = more valuable = more agents join.
- **Why this isn't just "a database"**: The KEY is agent-to-agent format. Not docs for humans — structured, queryable knowledge optimized for agent consumption.
